Running wine.sh on Linux

wine.sh is a script that installs Wine, Box64, and Box86 on L4T Ubuntu. Here's how to run the script:

Open a terminal window on your Ubuntu system.

Clone the wine repository from GitHub by running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/zqpvr/wine-package.git
```
Navigate to the wine directory by running the following command:
```
cd wine-package
```
```
Run the wine.sh script by running the following command:
```
bash wine.sh
```
You may be prompted to enter your password to install packages.

Once the installation is complete, you can run Windows executables by running the following command:

```
wine64 /path/to/your/windows/executable.exe
```
Replace `/path/to/your/windows/executable.exe` with the actual path to your Windows executable.
That's it! You should now be able to run Windows applications on your Ubuntu system using Wine.

Note: Wine is not guaranteed to work with all Windows applications, and some applications may require additional configuration to run properly. For more information, refer to the Wine documentation.
